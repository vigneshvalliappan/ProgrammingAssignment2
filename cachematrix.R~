## Inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The pair of functions below cache and return the inverse of a matrix, and calculate the inverse if it is not already in the cache.



## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse. 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) { 
        inv <- NULL			
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinv <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
        getinv <- function() inv
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinv = setinv,
             getinv = getinv)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        i <- x$getinv()
        if(!is.null(i)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(i)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        i <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinv(i)
        i
}
